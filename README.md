# GlobalRepresentationRing
A program produced in CoCalc (kernel: sagemath 9.8) which produces tables for global representation rings of a finite group G.

Let G be a finite group and X a G-set. Then X can be decomposed into a disjoint of orbits, X_i. By the Orbit Stabiliser Theorem the X_i are are equivalent to G/Stab(x_i) for any x_i \in X_i. Note that choosing a different x_i' \in X_i results in quotienting by a conjugate of Stab(x_i) - but these two G-sets are of course isomorphic. 

Therefore, all finite G-sets are generated by G sets of the form G/H, where H is a subgroup of G. Morevoer, we don't need to consider all H, but only one per equivalence class of subgroups up to conjugation.

Let G be a finite group and N a normal subgroup. The main idea behind the (reduced) global representation ring is to consider "G equivariant vector bundles on finite G/N sets." That is, G equivarant vector bundles on G sets of the form G/H where N < H < G. 

Note: The global representation ring (as in [Witherspoon, The Ring of Equivariant Vector Bundles on Finite Sets, 1995]) occurs when N={e}, this is why the prefix 'reduced' is included above.

It is well known that G equivarant vector bundles on G/H are in 1-1 correspondence with H-representations. [Segal, Equivaraint K-theory, 1968] Therefore our (reduced) global representation ring is generated by pairs (G/H, V) where V is an irreducible H-representation. 

There also exists a mark on such pairs. Namely, let K < G with N < K, and let k \in K. Then we define the mark (G/H,V)(K,k) = \sum_{g \in (G/H)^K} \chi_V(g^{-1}kg) where 'g \in (G/H)^K' means take a representative in G for each coset in (G/H)^K, and \chi_V denotes the character of V.

This information can be encoded in a table - with rows labelled by (simple G-set, irreducible representation) pairs and columns labelled by (subgroup,element) pairs and with entries of the table given by the marks.

The final thing to note it that if any two elements k,k' \in K are conjugate by an element in N_G(K) then all marks will be equal (that is, the columns corresponding to k and k' will be identical), therfore we only need to take one element for each orbit of N_G(K) acting on K. Similarly we only need one irreducible representation in each orbit of N_G(H) acting on Irr(H), as two irreducible representations in the same orbit will have identical rows in the table. 

This code will produce these reduced tables. The input is a group G and a normal subgroup N.
